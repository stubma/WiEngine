  @subsection whatisit What is WiEngine?
  WiEngine is a open-source cross-platform 2D game engine developed by WiYun Inc. WiEngine inherits design pattern of cocos2d, and introduces many new
  features and improvements. Now WiEngine supports Android 2.0+, iOS 3.2+, Mac OS X 10.6+, and Windows (Above WinXP).
